# Image Segmentation with TensorFlow

Convolutional Neural Network built using OpenCV and Tensorflow for [this](https://www.kaggle.com/c/tgs-salt-identification-challenge) Kaggle competition. 

This is an implementation of "U-Net" described in [this](https://arxiv.org/abs/1505.04597) paper. The name "U-Net" comes from the "U" shape of the convolution and upsampling layers in the network.
